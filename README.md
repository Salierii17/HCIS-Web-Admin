## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   PHP 8.2+
-   Composer
-   Node.js & NPM
-   A database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git)
    cd your-repo
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    composer install
    npm install && npm run build
    ```

3.  **Set up your environment file:**

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Next, open the `.env` file and configure your database connection (`DB_*` variables) and application URL (`APP_URL`).

4.  **Generate application key:**

    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

5.  **Run database migrations:**
    _This will create all necessary tables, including those for Filament Shield._

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

6.  **Install Filament Shield and create a Super Admin:**
    _This is the most important step for setting up roles and permissions. The command will auto-discover your Filament resources, generate policies, and prompt you to create a Super Admin role and user._

    ```bash
    php artisan shield:install
    ```

    **Follow the interactive prompts carefully.** When asked if you want to create a `super_admin` role and user, answer **yes**.

7.  **(Optional) Seed additional demo data:**
    _If you have other seeders to populate the database with dummy employees, courses, etc., run them now._

    ```bash
    php artisan db:seed
    ```

8.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

You can now access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Logging In

## üì± Mobile App Integration

The attendance module exposes several API endpoints to communicate with the companion mobile application.

* **Authentication:** API requests are protected using **Laravel Sanctum** with Bearer Tokens. The mobile app must first authenticate via the `/login` endpoint to receive an API token for subsequent requests.
* **Base URL:** All API endpoints are prefixed with `http://your-domain.com/api/v1/`.
* **Key Endpoint Groups:**
    * **Authentication:** `POST /login`, `POST /logout`
    * **Attendance Management:** `POST /attendance` (Clock In), `PUT /attendance/{id}` (Clock Out), `GET /attendance` (History).
    * **Attendance Correction:** `POST /attendance-requests`
    * **User Profile:** `GET /profile`, `PUT /profile`, `POST /profile/photo`, `PUT /profile/password`
    * **Notifications:** `GET /notifications`, `POST /notifications/{id}/read`

For detailed API documentation, please refer to the Postman collection or the `API_DOCS.md` file in this repository.
